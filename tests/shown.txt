NOT U - -1/2 E.polarisability.E

vs. self energy U = 1/2(mu)(pol^-1)(mu)
for isotropic mu:
		U = 1/2(mu-1)(mu^2)E^2
		=> Exactly cancel

polarisabilities do not interact within cutoff range, do outside

2_proton_dist_ENERGY_test.py

charges still interact with dipoles within cutoff (for opposite molecules)
