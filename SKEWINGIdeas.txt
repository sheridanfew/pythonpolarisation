BASIC CONCEPTS IN POLARISABILITY TEST

SC Lattice at C60 density:

C60 FCC lattice constant = 14.052(5) A 
SC_a = FCC_a/(4**(1/3)) = 8.85252027682385 A

define ratio parameter, R = alpha_zz / alpha_xx,yy
Trace of pol. tensor == Trace of C60 pol tensor

Vary R in steps of 0.1 from 0.5 to 1.5, 2.0, 2.5

Barrier to CS in x and z directions

Reorganisation in x and z directions
