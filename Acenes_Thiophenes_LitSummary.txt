Huzak 2013 JCP - HF pretty good, basis set important, pol inc. superlinearly w. number of benzene rings (nap, ant, tet. 2 - 4)

Firouzi Theochem 2008 - HF, B3LYP 6-31g* -> superlinear inc. of pol in all directions w. number of electrons

Champagne 1994 - sublinear increase in axial alpha per unit with MP2
Van Faasen 2002 - similar to Champagne, near linear increase in alpha per unit for VK functional
Delaere et al. PCCP 2002 - similar, use B3LYP, saying improved static alpha over HF, cite C. Van Caillie and R. D. Amos, Chem. Phys. Lett., 2000, 328, 446. This paper does indeed find lower percentage error fo rB3LYP than HF, but all v. small molecules, and DFT problems with chains won't have been an issue.
