ISSUE WITH NORMALISATION

- New eta method will give MAGNITUDES out rather than ABSOLUTE values
- These will be identical for bonds, whose polarisability tensor is defined in only one direction, but NOT for atoms, in which each diagonal component of the polarizability tensor will be:

(MAG)

3 (comp)**2 = MAG ** 2

=> comp = MAG/(root 3)
